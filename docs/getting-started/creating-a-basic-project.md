In this example we will create a simple triangle. The same sample code can be used in any platform.

## 1. Using C++

In Supernova file tree there is a ```main.cpp``` file located in ```project/``` folder. This file is used to start the game development in C++. As you can see, there is a call for ```supernova.h```, that will call ```init()``` function when game started.

Edit it with the code:

``` c++
#include "Supernova.h"
using namespace Supernova;

#include "Polygon.h"

Scene scene;
Polygon triangle(&scene);

void init(){
    triangle.addVertex(0, -100);
    triangle.addVertex(-50, 50);
    triangle.addVertex(50, 50);

    triangle.setPosition(Vector3(300,300,0));
    triangle.setColor(0.6, 0.2, 0.6, 1);

    Engine::setCanvasSize(1000,480);
    Engine::setScene(&scene);
}
```

## 2. Using Lua

In Supernova file tree there is a ```main.lua``` file located in ```project/lua/``` folder. This file is used to start the game development in Lua. You can call any other Lua files by this.

Edit it with the code:

``` lua
scene = Scene()
triangle = Polygon(scene)

triangle:addVertex(0, -100)
triangle:addVertex(-50, 50)
triangle:addVertex(Vector3(50, 50,0))

triangle.position = Vector3(300,300,0)
triangle:setColor(0.6, 0.2, 0.6, 1)

Engine.setCanvasSize(1000,480)
Engine.setScene(scene)
```

Now you can **run** to see the result.

!!! warning
    If you have both Lua and C++ calling Supernova static method ```setScene()```, the last call will be from C++, so Lua code will not work. Use ```NO_CPP_INIT``` or ```NO_LUA_INIT``` macro to avoid init to be called.

    For example, to build with ```NO_CPP_INIT```:

    - CMake: ```cmake -S . -B build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug -DNO_CPP_INIT=1 -G "Visual Studio 17 2022" -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX:PATH=instdir```    
    - Build tool: ```python3 supernova.py --build --platform windows --no-cpp-init```

    See [Building](/getting-started/building/building-for-windows/) for more.


## 3. Running the Project

Considering you have [built and installed](/getting-started/building/building-for-windows/) the project, you can run it by going to `instdir/bin` and opening the executable there.

After you make changes to the code, you have to build and install it again.
